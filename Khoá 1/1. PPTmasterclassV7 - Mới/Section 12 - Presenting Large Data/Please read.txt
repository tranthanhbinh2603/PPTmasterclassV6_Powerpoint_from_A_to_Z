This is just example data if you would like to follow what I do in the lectures.
This section doesn't require you to work along, you can just watch the lectures. 
BUT, if you want to learn you can use this file. Each presentation is different
and it's difficult to always know how to approach large data, but practice never
hurts, so enjoy this file.

Best,
Andrew
